# Automation-Essay-Scoring
Objective of this project is to develop a system to handle the challenge in grading posed by the variety of answers in the essay questions and the high number of students. I utilized the  Naive Bayes method for training a dataset and making prediction scores from students' answers by learning based on studentsâ€™ essay features and tutor scores.
